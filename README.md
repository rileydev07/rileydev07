Beginner-friendly and open-source software for **data-mining games made with Unreal Engine**. Its interface was carefully created to be easy to understand, but complete in the features it offers. Weâ€™ve been building this since **March 5th, 2019**, first as a side-project, later at a Team level.

### ðŸ“Œ Contributing to the ecosystem

We highly rely on contribution for the projects we work on, to make FModel even better. We encourage open collaboration made by the community, if you are a developer, feel free to contribute:
